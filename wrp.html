					My journey towards Web Developement did not start right away. Before I ventured into this complex and creative field I first was an Art Teacher teaching at Winslow High School. After that ran its course I decided to become strictly an artist, creating art pieces for my customers. Finally I found coding and Web Developement, which is where I found a field where your creativity intertwines with structure, which is the combination of my two previous professions I pursued.

					Through Web Developement I want to continually want to keep creating and making interesting, yet simple and interactive websites and designs to constantly engage the user and grasp their attention.
